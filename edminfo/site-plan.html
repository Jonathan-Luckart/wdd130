        Welcome to EDM info, a place where all your digital music questions will be answered, and curiousties satiated. What is EDM? EDM (Electronic Dance music) is an umbrella term for genres which are produced electronically with a computer and/or other electronic devices such as standalone synthesizers or mixers, and was typically created for the purpose of festivals and raves before evolving into the universal upbeat phenomena it is now.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many popular artists under the EDM category such as Skrillex, Steve Aoki, Hardwell, Excision, Deadmau5, Daft Punk, TheFatRat, Illenium, and many more (these artists will be listed with pictures in a grid style format).
      </p>
      <p>
        The genres of EDM are widely diverse and expansive, ranging from calm happy melodies to near pure white noise with dark undertones. Some happier subgenres of EDM are future bass, melodic dubstep, ambient, house, electro-swing, drum and bass (this will be a list on the left hand side). Some darker subgenres of EDM are trap, deathstep, dubstep, hardcore, speedcore, deep dub (this will be a list on the right hand side).
      </p>
      <p>
        We will be exploring these genres based on these two moods for the two pages. Instead of an EDM jargon chart this webpage lets users explore the music with ease.
